# Personality-Types

## My-Typologies

This repository provides a detailed breakdown of various personality typology systems, each based on different psychological theories and frameworks. The purpose of this compilation is to give a comprehensive understanding of how personality is categorized, measured, and analyzed across several prominent models. These systems offer unique insights into human behavior, cognition, and social interactions. I have also explored these systems personally to better understand the nuances of my own thought processes and behaviors.
